## Introduction

> “Aller Angfang ist schwer”

I made a sort of promise to myself this year that I will stop procrastinating and start my personal blog. So I did, sort of. Its still a bit rough around the edges, I just started working with Gatsby and after browsing a number of different static-site generators and even more templates the exhaustion got the better of me, and I finally settled down with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/hexo-theme-tranquilpeak) theme. 
I assume this must have some sort of special significance when the first blog-post is on New Year’s Eve, and I guess there is some truth to that. 

Now, you might have questions, such as;

## What do I write?

Pretty much everything. This is a piece of myself. I’m not really the expressive kind but I try my best. I am a computer scientist and software engineer, and I have interest in many areas, such as Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Mathematics, Cryptography, Software engineering and design patterns, but also Music, Linguistics, History, Literature, Politics, Astronomy, and pretty much everything that piques the interest of my hyperactive brain time-to-time. I know, Jack of all trades or something along the lines.

So, to sum up, I would post about my old and new projects, how I did what I did, how I didn’t what I didn’t, and how it could be done better, as a reminder to myself that to err is human, and also to anyone who stumbled upon the jumbled up mess and hopefully also learn how to do what I did, and maybe do it better. But also I would post about things in the regular mundane life that interest me, that movie that I just watched, that book that I had finally finished after a year of dreadful stare-down between the book and I, or that little rant about how much I hate the fact that humanity went to space not because of some greater cause but because of the fear of nuclear annihilation.

So yeah, pretty diverse. Hope you don’t mind.

## Who am I?

I’m Batman. For more info, check out [this](http://github.com/s-bose).

## What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?

Before answering that, ask yourself this question, would knowing that answer rid us of the existential dread of humanity, the misery of poverty, depression, cancer and all the rational and irrational phobias of earthly and unearthly objects,
and most importantly, would it help you sleep any better? The answer is 四̴̡̰̗͕͈̜̖̲̝̝̠̩̤͓̦͉̗̇̉͆̅́二̷̛̮͖̬̼͓̝͕̝̲̩̞̠̳̯̥̤͓̃̓̾̎͊̓̽̅͋͌͂͝

## Epilogue

That was mildly over-expressive for a first post, but stay tuned for more. I’ll try to post weekly, hopefully arrange a newsletter in the future if this gains some traction. Till then, I guess I'll see you around, random internet traveller!

See you soon! 😀
Auf Wiedersehen!
